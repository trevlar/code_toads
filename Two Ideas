Here are the ideas from our group which made it to this point.

Our First Option = Preferred Option
Neighborhood Watch - I'm sure we'll come up with a catchy name for this online web application, but in the meantime, let me describe it's purpose and design.

The concept of this is to create a website that will set up individual neighborhoods as seperate groups to handle an emergency response system for thier own neighborhood. This will be able to send messages to those in the neighborhood who wants to be involve to recieve texts on thier cell phones or a voice message to a home phone. It will also have information that may not be critical that will be available on the website so those in each individual neighborhood can see.

Possible nodes that could be included would be alerts for break ins, earthquakes, fires and other emergency related items. Video feed in the neighborhood can be included, garage sales and medical problems of a neighbor. If there was an emergency or if someone noticed something suspicious, the user who noticed who press one button and an alert would be sent to the group. Then, after the issue was either resolved or called off, a follow up message would be sent. There could be a calander and announcement board. The users could of course decide what type of notifications they receive and how often they receive them.

Hotel Management Software - This application would be used to manage the rooms, upgrades, orders, and everything else hotel related. We could add modules as needed, to include orders of supplies and other management only pieces, but it would start with the simple management of room available. Would need an inventory of rooms and a calendar. Possible functions needed to schedule housekeeping, accept online reservations, calculate charges.
